        Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,

        Lorem Ipsum is unadulterated drivel. It means nothing whatsoever, but it's surprisingly useful. The main idea behind lorem ipsum is to have 'convincing' text, separated into words, paragraphs and with punctuation etc. This 'text' is then used by DTP bureaux and web designers for roughing out document designs, illustrating text flow and run arounds before the final text arrives. It allows designers to show their proposals without having clients distracted by meaningful text. It also avoids fine publications like N.T.K. detecting irony which may become apparent in old web page drafts loitering around dusty servers which had English-language garbage text used as filler. A FOLDOC definition of lorem ipsum is here.
